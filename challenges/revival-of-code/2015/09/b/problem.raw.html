<article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>The next year, just to show off, Santa decides to take the route with the <em>longest distance</em> instead.</p>
<p>He can still start and end at any two (different) locations he wants, and he still must visit each location exactly once.</p>
