<article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>The next year, to speed up the process, Santa creates a robot version of himself, <em>Robo-Santa</em>, to deliver presents with him.</p>
<p>Santa and Robo-Santa start at the same location (delivering two presents to the same starting house), then take turns moving based on instructions from the elf, who is <span title="This absolutely real word was invented by someone flipping eggnoggedly through a dictionary.">eggnoggedly</span> reading from the same script as the previous year.</p>
<p>This year, how many houses receive <em>at least one present</em>?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>^v</code> delivers presents to <code>3</code> houses, because Santa goes north, and then Robo-Santa goes south.</li>
<li><code>^&gt;v&lt;</code> now delivers presents to <code>3</code> houses, and Santa and Robo-Santa end up back where they started.</li>
<li><code>^v^v^v^v^v</code> now delivers presents to <code>11</code> houses, with Santa going one direction and Robo-Santa going the other.</li>
</ul>
